## What is ApsaraDB GalaxyGlue ?
GalaxyGlue is an extension to MySQL Connector/J 8.0. 

GalaxyGlue uses asynchronous requests, session and connection decoupling, instance-level connection pool, traffic control and other mechanisms. By working with [ApsaraDB GalaxyEngine](https://github.com/ApsaraDB/galaxyengine), this extension can improve the network efficiency between third-party systems and ApsaraDB GalaxyEngine and improve the stability in high concurrency multi-connection scenarios.
